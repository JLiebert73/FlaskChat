<p>
    <strong>Key Features:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>User-friendly chat interface</li>
        <li>Real-time messaging using Socket.IO</li>
        <li>RESTful architecture for managing resources</li>
        <li>Atomic design principles for a modular and maintainable structure</li>
        <li>User authentication and registration</li>
        <li>Message history storage</li>
    </ul>

    <strong>Technologies Used:</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>Flask - A micro web framework for Python</li>
        <li>Socket.IO - For real-time bidirectional communication</li>
        <li>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript - For the frontend interface</li>
        <li>SQLite - A lightweight relational database for message storage</li>
    </ul>

    <strong>RESTful Design:</strong>

    <p></p><p>
    <strong>Atomic Design:</strong></p>
    Atomic design principles are applied to create modular and reusable UI components. This ensures consistency in design and ease of maintenance as the app evolves.
